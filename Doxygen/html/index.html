	<h3>
		Welcome to the Doxygen page of The adventures of the hungover.<br>
		This website will give an explanation of how the source code works.<br>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<br>
		In the source we used the following classes and libraries: <br>
		<br>
		<b>Ability</b><br>
		The player and even every NPC has abilities in their sprite sheets.<br>
		The class ability will create everything that is needed for one ability.<br>
		We've decided to make this a class so that a NPC can have a storage unit where all abilities can be loaded as objects.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Button_actions </b><br>
		Button_actions is a global library.<br>
		This class is made so that we can check mouse buttons and keyboard buttons without rewriting the function over and over.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Dialogbox </b><br>
		With this class we can make a certain dialogbox appear in the game.<br>
		The text will be loaded from the database and then set on the dialogbox with the function text_input(...).<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Exception_list </b><br>
		The exception_list is a global class library consisting exception that could happen in the game.<br>
		As well as the button_actions library, we didn't want to rewrite the exceptions in multiple classes and therefore made this library.<br>
		But the other reason this class is made is so that we can find all exceptions in one place.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Game </b><br>
		The game class is the actual game. This means that if the game loop has started you'll be able to play.<br>
		This is a class because we needed a seperation between game states, and with a class you can easier switch between them.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Inventory </b><br>
		The inventory is a class that has a list of the items of the player.<br>
		The list of items are all objects of class item.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Item </b><br>
		We've decided to create a seperate class of item objects, because every item has different values.<br>
		With the given functions you can read those values.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Leveleditor </b><br>
		This is a class what is called from the main if the level editor button is pressed.<br>
		This class wil start a loop where you can create your own level and save it in the database.<br>
		When a level is saved we can load it in the game. (In this version only when we change the level id in the code)<br>
		We've decided to make this a seperated class so that the game states can be handled easely.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Main_menu </b><br>
		This class is the main menu of the game.<br>
		Here you can select what you want to do in the game: start game or start level editor.<br>
		We've made this a seperate class so that the game states are easely separated.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Music </b><br>
		This is a class where you can play a certain music tune.<br>
		It is only a small class, but we did not want to rewrite the functions in de code when we want to play a different tune,<br>
		so we've outsourced it to a class.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Npc </b><br>
		With he NPC (Non-Playing Character) class you'll be able to easely load a new NPC out of the database.<br>
		This NPC then knows its position on the map, its name and its display.<br>
		We've made this a class so we can call a function of a certain NPC without looking it up in struct values.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Objects </b><br>
		This class has a factory pattern with what you can easy load background tiles, objects and even different buttons.<br>
		<br>
		 <b>Player </b><br>
		With this class you can make an object for a player.<br>
		In the class you'll notice that the player is actually a NPC.<br>
		But the player will need more information then a standard NPC so that is why we've decided to make a seperate class for it.<br>
		 <br>

		 <b>Sql</b><br>
		The sql class is one of the more complex classes in the game.<br>
		This class makes the connection to the database,<br>
		and had a lot of function with what you can get certain values from the database.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
